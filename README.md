# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning 

This repository contains an end-to-end Machine Learning project for predicting diabetes using classical supervised learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, optimization, and deployment through an interactive Streamlit application.

##  Project Overview

Early detection of diabetes is crucial for effective health management. This project uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** to build and evaluate predictive models that classify whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic based on medical attributes.

Two models are initially compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

The final deployed model is an **optimized Logistic Regression model**, selected based on superior recall and F1-score, which are critical metrics for medical screening tasks.

---

## Objectives

- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing
- Handle invalid or erroneous medical values
- Train and compare Logistic Regression and LDA models
- Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- Improve model performance using class balancing and threshold tuning
- Deploy the final optimized model using Streamlit

## Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Replaced physiologically invalid zero values using median imputation
- Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Used stratified train-test split (80–20)

### 2. Model Training & Evaluation
- Trained Logistic Regression and LDA models
- Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification metrics
- Compared baseline model performance

### 3. Model Improvement
- Applied `class_weight='balanced'` to address class imbalance
- Tuned decision threshold to optimize recall and F1-score
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Selected the best-performing model based on clinical relevance

### 4. Final Model Selection
- **Balanced Logistic Regression with threshold = 0.4**
- Prioritized recall to reduce false negatives
- Saved the final model and preprocessing pipeline as a `.pkl` file

##  Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

The final model achieved the best trade-off between recall and overall performance, making it suitable for a medical screening scenario.
